    <h1>A little about me</h1>
    
    <p class="subtextcenter">I am currently enrolled at Kennesaw State University and am pursuing a masters in Software Engineering. Working on various assignments and projects that encompass software engineering. Prior to KSU I graduated with a bachelors in Information Technology at Georgia Southern University. During my time at GSU many classes revolving around software engineering peeked my interest, hence leading me to follow down that path. </p>
